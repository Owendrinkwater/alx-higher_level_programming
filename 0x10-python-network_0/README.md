# 0x10. Python - Network #0

## Description
This project is about understanding how the web works at the **HTTP level** and learning how to use **cURL** and **Python scripts** to interact with web servers.  
It introduces the basics of **HTTP requests and responses**, **status codes**, **headers**, and how to send requests using different methods such as `GET`, `POST`, and more.  
You will also learn how to retrieve and analyze the size of HTTP response bodies, send custom headers, and handle redirections using cURL.
